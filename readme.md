# rocket_server_recipes

Building a web server with Rocket

## pre-requisites

-   A running postgres database: credentials can be updated on the `Rocket.toml` config
-   This project shares the same workspace from this other [recipe](https://github.com/collinsmuriuki/diesel_database_recipes). Therefore the projects should be cloned together.
